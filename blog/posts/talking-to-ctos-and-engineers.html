      <h1>Talking to CTOs and engineers when you’re a salesperson who isn’t technical</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
      <p>There’s a special kind of humiliation you only feel when you’re on a call with engineers and you realize, mid-sentence, that you’re confidently explaining something you barely understand. It’s not anger they give you in return — it’s the calm, quiet disappointment of someone watching a person drown slowly in a shallow pool.</p>

      <p>I’ve lived that moment enough times to develop something like PTSD around certain technical phrases. You hear acronyms. They hear architecture. You hear “feature”. They hear “failure mode”.</p>

      <p>Early in my career, I tried to fake it. I memorized buzzwords. One time I tried to explain “data consistency guarantees” to an engineer. He listened politely until I finished, then said, <em>“Yeah, that’s… not how any of this works.”</em> The rest of the call died like a candle in the wind.</p>

      <h2>The Turning Point</h2>

      <p>Years later, I realized something obvious: <strong>Engineers don’t expect you to understand the system. They expect you to understand the cost of being wrong.</strong></p>

      <p>The turning point came during a call with a CTO who looked like he hadn’t slept in three days. He said, <em>“Look, I don’t need another salesperson trying to impress me. I need someone who won’t create more work for my team.”</em></p>

      <p>I admitted — bluntly — that I wasn’t technical. Just: <em>“I’m not technical and I won’t pretend. Tell me how you think, what you fear, what you don’t want me to screw up, and I’ll work around you.”</em></p>

      <p>The whole call shifted. This wasn’t a technology conversation. It was a therapy session disguised as a demo.</p>

      <blockquote>If you walk in trying to impress them, you lose. If you walk in trying to understand their world, they’ll give you the blueprint.</blockquote>

      <p>But here’s the twist: understanding their world doesn’t mean being technical. It means being able to say <strong>“I don’t know, but I’ll get you the truth”</strong> and then actually doing it.</p>

      <p>We won that deal. Not because our tech was perfect. But because they trusted that when something eventually broke (and something always breaks), we’d show up without lies.</p>

      <p>So here’s the part that younger reps never believe until they live it: <strong>Selling to engineers is the easiest kind of selling. But only after you stop performing.</strong></p>

      <p>If you’re honest, thoughtful, and unafraid to expose what you don’t know, they’ll open the door. If you fake competence, they will close it so gently you won’t even realize they locked it.</p>
