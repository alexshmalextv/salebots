      <h1>Why most B2B pipelines look full and close nothing</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
      <p>There was a quarter, years ago, when every Monday pipeline review felt like group therapy mixed with denial.</p>
      <p>Screens share, CRM open, graphs everywhere — the whole thing looked alive and impressive, like a fancy dashboard for a plane none of us were actually flying. Reps talked through their deals the way people talk about long-distance relationships: fondly, vaguely, optimistically, and with absolutely no evidence the other side is still involved.</p>

      <p>One deal in particular stuck with me. A rep — good guy, hard worker, great at small talk — had been “working” this account for four months. He kept adding notes like “great conversation” or “promising signals”.</p>
      <p>No dates. No names. No actions. Just abstract positive feelings.</p>

      <p>I remember opening the activity log. He sent the same follow-up line four times: <em>“Just bumping this to the top of your inbox :)”</em>. Just a man quietly whispering into a void and calling it pipeline progression.</p>

      <p>The moment I realized the deal was dead wasn’t when I read the silence. It was when I asked the rep one simple question:</p>
      <p><strong>“Why would they buy this now, and why from you specifically?”</strong></p>
      <p>He stared at the screen like he was trying to remember a dream that melted the second he woke up.</p>

      <blockquote>Pipeline inflation isn’t malicious. It’s emotional. Reps build a second world inside the CRM where deals behave like characters in a story instead of unpredictable human beings.</blockquote>

      <p>So one week I snapped. I filtered every deal by one criterion: <strong>does it have a scheduled next step with a real person, on a real date, attached to a real event?</strong></p>
      <p>If not — out.</p>
      <p>The number that survived was so small it felt like a crime scene. But within six weeks, close rate went up. Cycle time went down. Forecast accuracy improved so much that finance sent us a thank-you note.</p>
      <p>An empty pipeline at least forces clarity. A bloated one gives everyone permission to pretend.</p>

      <p>Now, whenever I look at a pipeline, I ask myself three questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is this a record of conversations, or a record of wishful thinking?</li>
        <li>If this rep were paid only on deals with scheduled next steps, would half of these evaporate?</li>
        <li>And the most brutal one: <strong>If I had to bet my own money on the next deal to close, would I pick anything on this screen?</strong></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Most of the time the answer is no. And that tells you everything you need to know about why pipelines look full and close nothing.</p>
