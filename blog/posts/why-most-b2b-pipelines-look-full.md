# Why most B2B pipelines look full and close nothing

There was a quarter, years ago, when every Monday pipeline review felt like group therapy mixed with denial.
Screens share, CRM open, graphs everywhere — the whole thing looked alive and impressive, like a fancy dashboard for a plane none of us were actually flying.
Reps talked through their deals the way people talk about long-distance relationships: fondly, vaguely, optimistically, and with absolutely no evidence the other side is still involved.

One deal in particular stuck with me.
A rep — good guy, hard worker, great at small talk — had been “working” this account for four months. The opportunity value kept growing every week. He kept adding notes like “great conversation” or “promising signals” or “they’re excited about next steps”. When I asked what the next steps were, he mumbled something about “alignments” and “internal discussions”.
No dates.
No names.
No actions.
Just abstract positive feelings.

I remember opening the activity log and seeing the last outbound email he sent.
A follow-up with the line, “Just bumping this to the top of your inbox :)”.
He sent that same line four separate times, two weeks apart each.
Nothing else.
No call attempt.
No reframe.
No new angle.
Just a man quietly whispering into a void and calling it pipeline progression.

The moment I realized the deal was dead wasn’t when I read the buyer’s silence — silence is normal in B2B.
The moment I realized it was dead was when I asked the rep one simple question:
“Why would they buy this now, and why from you specifically?”
He stared at the screen like he was trying to remember a dream that melted the second he woke up.

That’s when it hit me:
Pipeline inflation isn’t malicious. It’s emotional.
Reps build a second world inside the CRM, a safe one, where deals behave like characters in a story instead of unpredictable human beings with no obligation to continue the conversation.

So one week I snapped.
Not dramatically — no shouting, no theatrics — just a quiet decision that the fantasy had gone on too long. I filtered every deal by one criterion: does it have a scheduled next step with a real person, on a real date, attached to a real event?

If not — out.

The number that survived was so small it felt like a crime scene.
The CEO looked genuinely betrayed, like I’d vaporized revenue with a keystroke.
Reps were angry because their “momentum” disappeared.
But nobody could explain the deals I removed.
Not one rep could tell a coherent story about those opportunities — who the buyer was, what hurt, what changed recently, why the timing mattered.

A pipeline full of unexamined optimism is worse than an empty one.
An empty pipeline at least forces clarity.
A bloated one gives everyone permission to pretend.

The funniest part? Within six weeks, close rate went up.
Cycle time went down.
Forecast accuracy improved so much that finance sent us a thank-you note — the first and last time that ever happened.
The reps who initially panicked started feeling something they hadn’t felt in months: traction.
Real traction.
Not the illusion of it.

There’s a specific kind of relief that washes over a team when they finally stop dragging dead deals behind them.
You can almost hear the room exhale.

After that quarter, I started looking at pipelines like doctors look at X-rays.
Most people see white shapes and assume it’s normal.
A trained eye sees shadows where shadows shouldn’t be.

Now, whenever I look at a pipeline, I ask myself three questions:

Is this a record of conversations,
or a record of wishful thinking?

If this rep were paid only on deals with scheduled next steps,
would half of these evaporate?

And the most brutal one:
If I had to bet my own money on the next deal to close,
would I pick anything on this screen?

Most of the time the answer is no.
And that tells you everything you need to know about why pipelines look full and close nothing.
