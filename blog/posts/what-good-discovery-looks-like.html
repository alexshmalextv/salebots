      <h1>What good discovery looks like in a six-figure deal (and why almost nobody does it)</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
      <p>There’s this fantasy version of discovery that junior reps get taught: the calm, structured conversation where the buyer answers cleanly, the needs line up neatly, and the solution basically sells itself once you “ask the right questions”.</p>

      <p>I don’t know where that version of sales exists. In the real world, discovery in a six-figure deal feels more like walking through a building after a fire and trying to figure out what burned first.</p>

      <p>I remember one call. Corporate room. Muted lighting. Buyers all wearing that expression people have in meetings they didn’t choose to attend. The CTO looked exhausted. Not busy—exhausted.</p>

      <p>So I said something you’re “not supposed” to say: <em>“You look like someone who’s been firefighting longer than anyone’s admitting. Where’s the real damage?”</em></p>

      <p>Silence. Three seconds. Five. Then he sighed in this way I’ve only heard from people who’ve been carrying a secret too heavy for too long.</p>

      <p>He told me about outages nobody outside the team knew about. He told me the CFO thought everything was fine because the team hid the worst metrics. He told me an engineer was on the verge of quitting.</p>

      <p><strong>That’s discovery.</strong></p>

      <blockquote>People think discovery is asking questions. It’s really about absorbing someone else’s chaos without blinking.</blockquote>

      <p>Later, they asked if our solution could “absolutely guarantee no outages”. Every cell in my body wanted to say yes. Instead I said: <em>“No. But I can tell you exactly why you’re having outages today, and which of those we remove entirely versus which stay on your side.”</em></p>

      <p>The PM flinched. The CTO nodded slowly. Honesty hurts the person who wants hope, but it calms the person who carries responsibility.</p>

      <p>And that’s when I realized something: good discovery isn’t about making the buyer like you — it’s about making the buyer trust you more than they trust their fear.</p>

      <p>If discovery feels clean and polite, you didn’t uncover anything that matters. Six-figure problems aren’t polite. Six-figure stakes aren’t polite. Six-figure teams certainly aren’t polite.</p>

      <p>Real discovery is uneven. Messy. Sometimes awkward. I’ve left discovery calls feeling like I’d just witnessed a confession. But I’ve never left feeling confused.</p>
      
      <p>You want the secret? Fine. <strong>If the buyer doesn’t feel lighter at the end of the call, you didn’t do discovery. You did a questionnaire.</strong></p>
