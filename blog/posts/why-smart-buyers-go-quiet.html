      <h1>Why smart buyers go quiet after “send me a proposal”</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="content">
      <p>I used to think “send me a proposal” was a small trophy. Like I’d passed some invisible test.</p>
      
      <p>I’d close the call with this dumb optimism, make coffee, open a document, and spend the next few hours polishing a masterpiece nobody asked for. Back then I thought sales was about earning moments of encouragement.</p>

      <p>But the part I remember most clearly isn’t the writing. <strong>It’s the waiting.</strong></p>

      <p>There was a phase in my life when I would literally sit at my laptop the way a dog sits at the door when it hears footsteps outside — ears up, heart up, hoping the next email notification would be “let’s move forward”.</p>

      <p>Nothing came. Not tomorrow, not next week, not ever.</p>

      <p>At first I blamed my proposal. Too long? Too short? Wrong tone? Too technical? Not technical enough? Then I blamed the buyer. “Unprofessional.” “Disrespectful.” “Why can’t they just tell me no?”</p>

      <h2>The Hard Truth</h2>

      <p>It took me years to admit the truth: <strong>the buyer went quiet because the deal was never real.</strong> And deep down I knew it.</p>

      <p>I’d been talking to someone who liked the idea, liked the conversation, liked me even — but didn’t own the problem, didn’t own the budget, didn’t own the decision. They simply said the one phrase that ends a call smoothly.</p>

      <blockquote>
        A buyer who actually wants to move never ends a high-stakes call with vague homework for you. They start involving people. They ask about timelines. They pressure you.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Silence after a proposal isn’t a mystery. It’s the sound of you finally hearing the truth you ignored during the call.</p>

      <p>I remember one deal where the buyer asked for a proposal with this enthusiastic voice, like we were about to start something big. I stayed up half the night building the doc. Three hours of sleep. Sent it at 8 a.m. By lunch I refreshed my inbox more than I breathed.</p>

      <p>Two weeks later I realized his enthusiasm wasn’t for the solution. <strong>It was for ending the meeting without disappointing me.</strong></p>

      <p>There’s a kind of pain you only feel once — the pain of understanding you weren’t ghosted; you simply refused to listen when the deal told you it was dead.</p>

      <h2>The Fix</h2>

      <p>Now when someone says “send me a proposal”, I don’t get excited. I get curious.</p>

      <p><em>“Walk me through what happens on your side after you read it.”</em></p>
      
      <p>If they can’t answer that, the deal goes straight back to “maybe”, not “almost there”. The inbox silence still hurts sometimes, but at least now I know why it happens.</p>
