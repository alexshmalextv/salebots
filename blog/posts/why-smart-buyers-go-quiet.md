# Why smart buyers go quiet after “send me a proposal”

I used to think “send me a proposal” was a small trophy.
Like I’d passed some invisible test.
I’d close the call with this dumb optimism, make coffee, open a document, and spend the next few hours polishing a masterpiece nobody asked for.

Back then I thought sales was about earning moments of encouragement.

But the part I remember most clearly isn’t the writing.
It’s the waiting.

There was a phase in my life when I would literally sit at my laptop the way a dog sits at the door when it hears footsteps outside — ears up, heart up, hoping the next email notification would be “let’s move forward”.

Nothing came.
Not tomorrow, not next week, not ever.

At first I blamed my proposal. Too long? Too short? Wrong tone? Too technical? Not technical enough?
Then I blamed the buyer. “Unprofessional.” “Disrespectful.” “Why can’t they just tell me no?”

> **It took me years to admit the truth:  
> the buyer went quiet because the deal was never real.  
> And deep down I knew it.**

I’d been talking to someone who liked the idea, liked the conversation, liked me even — but didn’t own the problem, didn’t own the budget, didn’t own the decision.
They simply said the one phrase that ends a call smoothly.

A buyer who actually wants to move *never* ends a high-stakes call with vague homework for you.
They start involving people.
They ask about timelines.
They pressure you.

Silence after a proposal isn’t a mystery.
It’s the sound of you finally hearing the truth you ignored during the call.

I remember one deal where the buyer asked for a proposal with this enthusiastic voice, like we were about to start something big. I stayed up half the night building the doc.
Three hours of sleep.
Sent it at 8 a.m.
By lunch I refreshed my inbox more than I breathed.

Two weeks later I realized his enthusiasm wasn’t for the solution.
It was for ending the meeting without disappointing me.

> There’s a kind of pain you only feel once — the pain of understanding you weren’t ghosted; you simply refused to listen when the deal told you it was dead.

Now when someone says “send me a proposal”, I don’t get excited. I get curious.
“Walk me through what happens on your side after you read it.”
If they can’t answer that, the deal goes straight back to “maybe”, not “almost there”.

**The inbox silence still hurts sometimes, but at least now I know why it happens.**
