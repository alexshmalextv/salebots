      <p>(and the part nobody tells you: none of us were born with the skills we pretend to have)</p>
      
      <p>The strangest promotion of my life happened on a Tuesday morning with the emotional subtlety of a car crash. I walked into the office planning to answer emails. By noon, my manager quit. By 12:07 I was “Head of Sales”.</p>
      
      <p>No training. No ceremony. Just a Slack message from the CEO saying, <em>“We need continuity. You’re the strongest one we have.”</em></p>

      <p>There’s this myth in business that leaders appear fully formed. But the truth is uglier and lonelier: almost every leader is promoted before they’re ready. Most of us learned leadership the way people learn to swim after falling into a cold lake.</p>

      <p>My first week was a carnival of bad decisions. I rewrote messaging I didn’t understand. I redesigned the pitch deck three times. I was scrambling.</p>

      <blockquote>It turns out leadership isn’t a show of strength. It’s the ability to say: “I don’t have the answer yet, but I’m here, I’m paying attention, and I won’t bullshit you.”</blockquote>

      <p>The turning point came when a junior rep told me he felt stupid for not “naturally knowing” how to close big deals. I told him: <em>“Nobody naturally knows. The only difference between you and the ‘naturals’ is that they’ve failed more times than you’ve tried.”</em></p>

      <p>What made the difference wasn’t brilliance. It was one shift: <strong>I stopped trying to be someone who was born ready, and started being someone who was willing to learn publicly.</strong></p>

      <p>If someone suddenly puts you in charge of sales — or anything, really — and you feel like an imposter, remember this: The people who seem confident weren’t born that way. They just got comfortable walking into rooms they didn’t feel qualified to be in.</p>

      <p>And now it’s your turn.</p>
